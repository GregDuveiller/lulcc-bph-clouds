# lulcc-bph-clouds data repository

Here we describe the data repository containing the final results of the following study:
G. Duveiller et al. Widespread cloud enhancement adds further value to the world's forests. _Nature Communications_ (in review).

The data are stored in a dedicated data repository that is archived on Zenodo: [DOI: 10.xxxx/zenodo.xxxxxxx]
The code associated with this data is stored in a distinct repository, also archived on Zenodo: [DOI: 10.xxxx/zenodo.xxxxxxx]

## Organisation of the data

The data repository is organised at two levels. 
+ folder __study_results__ contains the final data generated in the study. The code necessary to produce this data can be found in the __code/process__ folder in the code repository
+ folder __data_4_figures__ contains a more condensed format of the data, providing what is required to reproduce the figures in the paper. The code necessary to *harvest* this data from the larger data results stored in the folder __study_results__ can be found in the __code/harvest__ folder of the code repository. Finally, the code to generate the figures from the folder __data_4_figures__ can be found in the __code/figures__ folder of the code repository.
